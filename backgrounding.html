		<h2>Must-have tools</h2>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.accurint.com/">Accurint</a> Talk to John Wareham to get an account login. And here's a <a href="http://www.accurint.com/pdf/accurintguide.pdf">how-to guide.</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://pa.courts.state.mn.us/default.aspx">MNCIS</a> -Minnesota criminal and civil court searches.</li>
		<li><a href="https://pacer.login.uscourts.gov/csologin/login.jsf?court_id=00pcl">PACER</a> -federal court, including bankruptcy</li>
		<li>In-house databases are currently available through <a href="http://panda.star.local/#search/all">PANDA.</a> This includes: voter registration, births, deaths, jail bookings (not there quite yet), state prison history, criminal convictions, civil judgments, Hennepin County foreclosures, public employee payrolls, police officers licenses and some other datasets.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h2>Finding a phone number</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>First stop: <a href="http://www.accurint.com/">Accurint</a> Use the "phones plus" option. And yes, they do have cell phones.</li>
		<li><a href="http://panda.star.local/#search/all">Voter registration data</a> has some phone numbers. You could use this as a starting point if you have nothing else. But you can't contact the person with this as the sole source. Punch the phone number into Accurint or even run a Google search to see if you can find an alternate source. Voter data can only be used for election-related purposes.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.phonevalidator.com/index.aspx">Phone validator</a>: Check to see if a phone is a cell or landline</li>
		<li>Try people search engines such as: <a href="https://www.pipl.com/">Pipl</a> or <a href="https://www.spokeo.com/">Spokeo</a> or <a href="http://www.zabasearch.com/">Zabasearch</a> or <a href="http://www.123peoplesearch.com/">123People</a> or <a href="https://www.peekyou.com/">PeekYou</a> or <a href="https://thatsthem.com/">That'sThem</a> or <a href="https://www.whitepages.com/">Whitepages</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h2>Finding an address</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>First stop: <a href="http://www.accurint.com/">Accurint</a></li>
		<li>Try people search engines such as: <a href="https://www.pipl.com/">Pipl</a> or <a href="https://www.spokeo.com/">Spokeo</a> or <a href="http://www.zabasearch.com/">Zabasearch</a> or <a href="http://www.123peoplesearch.com/">123People</a> or <a href="https://www.peekyou.com/">PeekYou</a> or <a href="https://thatsthem.com/">That'sThem</a> or <a href="https://www.whitepages.com/">Whitepages</a></li>
		<li>Addresses might turn up in campaign finance contribution data. You can search <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/">federal campaign finance data</a>, or <a href="https://cfb.mn.gov/">Minnesota state-level campaign finance data</a> or look for <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/">data from other states.</a> Beware: Sometimes the address might be for that person's business.</li>
		
		</ul>
		
		
		<h2>Finding a date of birth</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>If the person has been to court for anything -- a divorce, a traffic ticket, criminal conviction -- they should turn up with a date of birth in <a href="http://pa.courts.state.mn.us/default.aspx">MNCIS</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://panda.star.local/#search/all">In-house datasets</a> that contain date of birth: MNCIS criminal convictions (includes traffic tickets), birth records includes DOBs of parents (if they gave birth to a child in Minnesota, good chance they are in here), jail bookings, state prisoners, police officer licenses.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.accurint.com/">Accurint</a> provides the month and year of birth. Sometimes that's enough to at least get you an age and/or help you confirm that you have the right person.</li>
		<li><a href="http://panda.star.local/#search/all">Voter registration data</a> includes the year of birth. You could use this as a starting point if you have nothing else. But you can't publish anything solely based on this source. Voter data can only be used for election-related purposes.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Finding relatives</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>First stop: <a href="http://www.accurint.com/">Accurint</a>. After you locate the person, there's a find "neighbors/relatives" feature. Or search by an address to try to find people living at the same address.</li>
		<li>Look for obituaries. Many you can find with just a Google search. If that doesn't work try <a href="http://www.nexis.com/">Nexis (check with John Wareham if you need a login)</a> or <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/">Newspapers.com</a>, which requires a subscription. Free accounts are available to Star Tribune employees.</li>
		<li>Try checking <a href="http://panda.star.local/#datasets/deathsbirths">Minnesota birth and death records</a> for children, parents, spouse, etc.</li>
		<li>Geneaology websites might turn up something. Try: <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/">Ancestry</a> or <a href="https://www.familytreenow.com/">FamilyTreeNow</a> or <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/">FamilySearch</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
		
		
		
		</ul>
		

		
		
		<h2>Criminal history, civil court cases, bankruptcies</h2>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="http://pa.courts.state.mn.us/default.aspx">MNCIS</a> -Minnesota criminal convictions, lawsuits, family, divorces, etc. You will only find closed cases. Go to a terminal at the Hennpepin County Courthouse to search open cases anywhere in the state.</li>
		<li><a href="https://cch.state.mn.us/">BCA criminal history database</a> -Must have a date of birth</li>
		<li><a href="https://pacer.login.uscourts.gov/csologin/login.jsf?court_id=00pcl">PACER</a> -federal court, including bankruptcy</li>
		<li>You can try to find similar search sites for <a href="http://www.ncsc.org/topics/access-and-fairness/privacy-public-access-to-court-records/state-links">other states here.</a> Beware: Not all states have a publicly accessible search like we do.</li>
		<li>Look for jail bookings or prison records. Try the <a href="https://coms.doc.state.mn.us/PublicViewer">BCA Offender locator</a> or <a href="https://www.vinelink.com/#/home/site/24002">Vinelink (which is national)</a> or search <a href="http://panda.star.local/#datasets/crime">PANDA</a> for jail booking records from all county jails in Minnesota, dating back to the 1990s and state prison data on all offenders ever tracked by the Minnesota Department of Corrections. (The data in PANDA is only updated once per year)</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.accurint.com/">Accurint</a> also has criminal history.</li>
		</ul>

		
		<h2>Finding someone's email address (other than a straight Google search)</h2>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.accurint.com/">Accurint</a> will sometimes turn up a person's email address. Might not always be current, though.</li>
		
		</ul>
		
		
		
		<h2>General web searches</h2>

		<li>Try other search engines such as: <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, which won't track your search history, or <a href="https://milionshort.com/">MillionShort</a>, which removes the most popular web hits, or <a href="https://www.bing.com/">Bing</a> or <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a></li>
		<li>Try people search engines such as: <a href="https://www.pipl.com/">Pipl</a> or <a href="https://www.spokeo.com/">Spokeo</a> or <a href="http://www.zabasearch.com/">Zabasearch</a> or <a href="http://www.123peoplesearch.com/">123People</a> or <a href="https://www.peekyou.com/">PeekYou</a> or <a href="https://thatsthem.com/">That'sThem</a> or <a href="https://www.whitepages.com/">Whitepages</a></li>

		</ul>
		
		<h2>Employment</h2>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="https://mn.gov/elicense/">Minnesota professional license lookup.</a> There are hundreds of jobs in MN that require licensure, including many you wouldn't expect.</li>
		<li>Are (or were) they a Minnesota state government employee?  If so, you can<a href="https://mn.gov/mmb/transparency-mn/"> download a copy of the state's payroll database</a> or get a copy of an older one. Data includes job titles, dates of employment, phone numbers and sometimes email addresses. It's also a good way to find co-workers.</li>
		<li>We also have a <a href="http://panda.star.local/#datasets/public-salaries">limited collection of payroll data</a> from metro area counties, the University of Minnesota and state government on PANDA. Many of these haven't been updated since 2014.</li>
		<li>See what <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> has to say (of course, it might not be accurate or the person might not have a profile).</li>
		<li>Do they own a business? <a href="http://www.sos.state.mn.us/business-liens/business-help/how-to-search-business-filings/"> Check the Minnesota business registrations.</a> Beware: rules are lax in Minnesota about what name(s) appear on the registration form.</li>
		<li>Are they a high-level manager at a non-profit? Their name, title and salary might show up in an IRS 990 form for that non-profit. Try searching<a href="http://www.guidestar.org/Home.aspx"> Guidestar, or <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/">ProPublica's Nonprofit Explorer</a></li>
		<li>Is the person a lobbyist at the state capitol? <a href="https://cfb.mn.gov/reports-and-data/viewers/lobbying/lobbyists/">Searchable lobbying reports</a> include phone and email (likely work-related) and is a good place to double check a name spelling.</li>
		
		</ul>
		<h2>Property and real estate</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>If you want to search by name to find what property a person owns, go to <a href="http://www.accurint.com/">Accurint</li>. Once you find the person, select the "property" option.</li>
		<li>If you are trying to find who owns a the property at a specific address, another option is to go the property search website for the specific county. These sites (listed below for the metro) allow you to search by address or parcel ID number only. If you're looking for a property in another county, try doing a Google search with the name of the county and "property search" and you'll likely find the right page.</li>
		<li><a href="https://beacon.schneidercorp.com/application.aspx?app=RamseyCountyMN&PageType=Search">Ramsey County property lookup</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.hennepin.us/residents/property/property-information-search">Hennepin County property lookup</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://mn-washington.manatron.com/">Washington County property lookup</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://gis2.co.dakota.mn.us/WAB/PropertyInformationPublic/index.html">Dakota County property lookup</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://prtinfo.co.anoka.mn.us/(v0j5f22fjqqmzu5505hfeoqu)/search.aspx">Anoka County property lookup</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.scottcountymn.gov/385/Search-for-Property-Information">Scott County property lookup</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://gis.co.carver.mn.us/publicparcel/">Carver County property lookup</a></li>
		<li>If you need to find property that a person owned in the past (but doesn't own now), you'll need to go to the recorder of deeds in the county where the property is located. Most counties have public computer terminals that you can use to do searches on deeds and usually there is someone there who can help get you started.</li>
		<li>Another way to find property ownership is to search real estate transactions. <a href="http://webapps6.star.local/NewsDept_WebApp/MainScreen.aspx">Real estate transactions in Minnesota</a> compiled by the Star Tribune from the e-crv filings (see below). Our data starts in early 2014 and is updated weekly, but the search interface gives you more options than what you'll find in the <a href="https://www.mndor.state.mn.us/ecrv_search/app/captcha;jsessionid=af0a9b773b15208c8369be386087">state's e-crv search page.</a></li>
		<li>We also have <a href="http://panda.star.local/#datasets/housing">Hennepin County foreclosure data</a>, dating back to 2006 (it's updated monthly). This might be a way to find someone's past address that could help narrow down an Accurint search for more current information.</li>

		
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Vital records - births, deaths, marriages, divorces</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>We have <a href="http://panda.star.local/#datasets/deathsbirths">Minnesota birth records in PANDA</a>, dating back to 1989, that are searchable by the names of the parents, as well as the child.  It includes the dates of birth for the parents, so this might be a good option for finding a date of birth. It is updated once a year and it lags by about one year (so for example, in spring 2018 we will get the 2017 births).</li>
		<li>We have <a href="http://panda.star.local/#datasets/deathsbirths">Minnesota death certificates in PANDA</a> dating back to 1970, that is searchable by name of the person who died, their spouse, and their mother and father (plus other search options). This might be a way to connect family members. This is udpated once per year.</li>
		<li>Minnesota <a href="https://www.moms.mn.gov/">marriage records</a> are searchable by names of the bride or groom. However, it only returns the names, plus date of marriage and county where the application was issued. You can request a copy of the certifcate, if you're willing to wait and pay a small fee.</li>
		<li>To find divorces, search <a href="http://pa.courts.state.mn.us/default.aspx">the Civil, Family & Probate Case records in MNCIS</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Other useful online databases</h2>
		<ul>

You can search <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/">federal campaign finance data</a>, or <a href="https://cfb.mn.gov/">Minnesota state-level campaign finance data</a> or look for <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/">data from other states.</a></li>

		<li>Search <a href="https://pacer.login.uscourts.gov/csologin/login.jsf?court_id=00pcl">PACER</a> for federal court cases, including bankruptcy filings.</li>
		<li>Look for jail bookings or prison records. Try the <a href="https://coms.doc.state.mn.us/PublicViewer">BCA Offender locator</a> or <a href="https://www.vinelink.com/#/home/site/24002">Vinelink (which is national)</a> or search <a href="http://panda.star.local/#datasets/crime">PANDA</a> for jail booking records from all county jails in Minnesota, dating back to the 1990s and state prison data on all offenders ever tracked by the Minnesota Department of Corrections. (The data in PANDA is only updated once per year)</li>

		<h2>General advice</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>#1 most important: Just because something is listed in 1 database doesn’t mean it’s true</li>
		<li>There is no “magic” website that will give you everything.</li>
		<li>Do a quick background check on everybody you write about: Even that person in the seemingly innocuous feature story.</li>
		<li>Start broad and narrow results on what you find</li>
		<li>Background yourself or a family member to test website accuracy</li>
		<li>Use bits of information as keys to unlock new data – i.e. when you get a DOB, go back and run previous searches that you did without the DOB.</li>
		<li>Don’t be afraid to let go of pieces you can’t confirm</li>
		<li>Keep a spreadsheet of your search results, including URLs</li>
		<li>Take a screenshot of key findings on websites (you have software called Snipping Tool)</li>

		</ul>
